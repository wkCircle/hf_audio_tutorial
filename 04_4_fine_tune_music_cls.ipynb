        "1. Use `load_dataset` to downlaod data and can `train_test_split()` to further partition data.\n",
        "2. Use `feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor(<model_id>, ...)` to load the corresponding feature extractor for the given model_id, which helps to extract relevant features for the target given model_id.\n",
        "3. When data has different sampling rate from what model requires, make sure to always convert the data so as to have the same sampling rate by `data.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=feature_extractor.sampling_rate))`. It is also a good idea to always input `data['sampling_rate']` to `feature_extractor` arg so it always validates if data's sampling rate matches what model requires, i.e., the `feature_extractor.sampling_rate`.\n",
        "4. standardize both train and test data by `data.map` on a customized function which in turn calles `feature_extractor` since it already provides similar functionalities.\n",
        "5. Define model structure: depending on the task, here we use `model = AutoModelForAudioClassification(<model_id>, ...)` that auto select appropriate classification head on top of the pre-trained model_id.\n",
        "6. Define training args via `TrainingArguments`, including whether you wish to generate report and store somewhere via `reports_to`, or push checkpointed model during training to hub via `push_to_hub`.\n",
        "7. Train the model via `trainer = Trainer(...); trainer.train()`.\n",
        "8. (optional) give further meta into a dict and then `trainer.push_to_hub(**dict)`.\n"
